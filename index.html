      <h2><strong>About me:</strong></h2>
    <p>I am making an attempt my in life to reinvent myself at this <span class="highlight">very moment.</span>
    After 10 years of being in a job I was not passionate about I chose to finally take a <span class="highlight">chance</span>. So, I looked 
    up tech bootcamps in my local area, which is when I discovered <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>! After looking in to their program
    I decided to give it a shot. Follow me along my journey into the tech industry.</p>
